This has been done manually but the bash command below can also be used instead.
echo $(tr -d '\n' < preproinsulin-seq.txt | sed 's/[^[:lower:]]//g')
First, use `tr` to trim new lines. Then, use `sed` to remove everything except 
lowercase alphabets. Sed is line-based so it's hard to work with newlines.
